## Null and Alternative hypotheses?
Null Hypothesis: no difference in health outcomes (weight, blood pressure, body fat, waist-to-hip ratio, and BMI) between the informed group (the ones who were told their work is exercise) and the control group (those who were not told). Or the control group shows a decrease in health outcomes compared to the informed group.

Alternative Hypothesis: the informed group shows better health outcomes compared to the control group. (exercise affects health in part or in whole via the placebo effect)


## 2. Primary Researchers
Alia J. Crum and Ellen J. Langer as part of the Department of Psychology at Harvard University

## 3.  Datasets referenced and their availability to the public
This study references The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention article called "Physical Activity and health: A report of the Surgeon General" from 1996 to determine the amount of exercise per day to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This is available to the public.  

Another reference used was Deutschman's "The placebo effect: An interdisciplinary exploration" to conclude that it is difficult to change the behavior of cutting back calories or changing food sources or the quality of food ingested. This is available to the public.


## 4. Why?
They are interested in collecting this data because they want to discover whether the relationship between exercise and health is or can be affected by one’s mindset. They are also trying to find another example of how powerful the placebo effect is and can perhaps be beneficial to one’s health.

## 5. Data recorded 
Eighty-four female room attendants working in seven different hotels were measured on physiological health variables affected by exercise. Each of the seven hotels was randomly assigned to one of two conditions: informed or control. Those in the informed condition were told that the work they do (cleaning hotel rooms) is good exercise and satisfies the Surgeon General's recommendations for an active lifestyle. Those in the control group were given all the same information as those in the informed group, except they did not receive information about how their work was good exercise until after the second set of measures was taken. 

~~~
The Surgeon General's recommendations state that all adults should accumulate at least 30 minutes of physical exercise per day for a healthy lifestyle (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, 1996).
~~~


All subjects were told that the purpose of the study was to find ways to improve the health and happiness of women in a hotel workplace. The subjects were given a questionnaire, and while they filled it out, they were taken one at a time to complete their physiological measures (weight, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, percentage body fat, waist-to-hip ratio, and body mass index). The data was collected from self-reported exercise (or perceived amount of exercise daily) from the questionnaire and the data from the physiological measures. Additionally, to improve the reliability of BP readings, the researchers controlled several variables that are known to cause fluctuation: substance abuse (subjects reported no significant changes in alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use during the study), diet (subjects reported no significant changes in their diet), time of day, hormonal regulation (taken 4 weeks apart to control for fluctuation due to menstruation), heart rate, and immediate physical activity (BP measured after subjects sat for at least 10 minutes to ensure that resting BP was measured). 

### Data not mentioned
Data that was left out was that the room attendants did not report any increase in exercise outside of work, not did they experience any increase in workload throughout the study. In addition, the subjects reported their habits had not changed over the past 30 days with respect to how much they ate (including servings of sugary foods and vegetables) and how much they drank (caffeine, alcohol, and water). This neither increased exercise nor decreased caloric intake was reported by the subjects. However, it is possible that the room attendants did change their behavior, cut back on calories, improve the quality of the food they ate, or work harder, but no such changes were reported. Additionally, the subjects in the informed group were significantly younger than the ones in the control group, which can significantly affect how their body responds to exercise. This age difference, although it wasn't intentional, wasn't properly taken into account when examining and comparing the physiological measures between the informed and control groups. 

## 6. Evidence supporting claim
This study presented the evidence that the shift in mind-set from the informed group was accompanied by remarkable improvement in physiological measures associated with exercise. After only 4 weeks of knowing that their work is good exercise, the subjects in the informed group lost an average of 3 points, lowered the systolic BP by 10 points, and were significantly healthier as measure by body-fat percentage, BMR and WHR. While these changes were small, they were meaningful considering the state of health the subjects were in and that the changed occured in just 4 weeks.

Further support for the possibility of the placebo effect in the benefits of exercise comes from the fact that the numerous studies linking exercise to health have generally relied on self-reported information to measure physical activity(Plante & Rodin, 1990); the results of these studies therefore reflect the relationship between health and perceived levels of physical activity, rather than actual levels. This raises the question of whether some of the positive gains of physical activity are due more to the perception of exercise and its association with health than to the actual performance of exercise. 


## 7. How was this study funded?
Presumably funded by Harvard University, although not explicitly said in the report. 


## 8. Was this study affected by publish or perish 
Yes

The data collected in this study did not directly support this conclusion. As mentioned, the room attendants did not report any increase in exercise outside of work, not did they experience any increase in workload over the course of the study. In addition to this, the subjects reported their habit had not changed over the past 30 days with respect to how much they ate (including servings of sugary goods and vegetables) and how much they drank (caffeine, alcohol, and water). Therefore, neither increase exercise nor decreased caloric intake was reported by the subjects which is important to accuractly determine whether the main reason for the decrease in physiological factors was exercise rather than diet or a another confounding variable. Additionally, while it looks like the results of the informed group showcase the alternative hypothesis, factors like age weren't taken into consideration (informed group was significantly younger than the control group). I believe this study deserves further investigation with other factors being taken into account. If I were to replicate this study, I would include a larger sample size, daily logs (where the informed and control group log their percieved exercise, food intake, other activities/daily routine, and liquid intake from that day), and perhaps other measures like metabolism to accurately compare the participants.
