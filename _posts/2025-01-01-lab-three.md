# Chosen Dataset: 100,000 Simulated Roulette Rounds

## 1. Which dataset did you work with? Where did you get it from? 
I worked with a dataset called "Simulated Roulette Data" that I got from the website Kaggle. There are multiple datasets when playing with different rounds (10, 100, 1000, etc), but I chose this dataset because it contains data from 100000 rounds and I wanted as much data as possible.

## 2. Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?
I'm interested in analyzing this dataset to see if these games are based on luck or if there is a possible strategic component to it.

## 3. Discuss your analysis of the dataset:
When I analyzed this dataset, I looked at variables like the Winning Number, Winning Color, whether it was a Red or Black win, and also whether it was a Even, Odd, or Zero bet win to decide whether there is a strategic or luck component to the game. 

### Most frequent color, number, and color-number pair
I found that the most frequent color and number in this dataset was 36 and Red. I also found that the most frequent color-number pair was also 36 and Red. This is slightly significant based on the fact that the number and color are the most repeated in the dataset (2815 times which is higher than the statistical probability of how many times the number should appear in a set of 100,000 (it should be about 2700 instead using the equation 100,000/37 (expected frequency for a uniform random process))), but it's not incredibly significant because there is a range for the number-color count to account for randomized variables.


### Correlation between Bet Types
I calculated the correlation between these variables (Red Bet, Black Bet Win, Even Bet Win, Odd Bet Win, and Zero Bet Win) to try to make different claims about different bet types. These were the results:
~~~
               Red Bet Win  Black Bet Win  Even Bet Win  Odd Bet Win  
Red Bet Win       1.000000      -0.947344     -0.078172     0.130829   
Black Bet Win    -0.947344       1.000000      0.130659    -0.078003   
Even Bet Win     -0.078172       0.130659      1.000000    -0.947343   
Odd Bet Win       0.130829      -0.078003     -0.947343     1.000000   
Zero Bet Win     -0.162318      -0.162201     -0.161731    -0.162789   

               Zero Bet Win  
Red Bet Win       -0.162318  
Black Bet Win     -0.162201  
Even Bet Win      -0.161731  
Odd Bet Win       -0.162789  
Zero Bet Win       1.000000

#### Correlation: 1.0
The correlation of any variable with itself will always be 1.0 because the relationship is linear. These values don't  provide meaningful information, so we have to look at correlations between different variables. 

#### Black Wins v.s. Red Wins  &  Even Wins v.s. Odd Wins
The negative correlation between black wins v.s. red wins indicates that when a red bit wins, its unlikely that a black bet will win, and vice versa. This makes sense since red and black are mutually exclusive outcomes in the game/simulation. There is also a strong negative correlation between even bet wins and odd bet wins, following the same logic as red and black wins with the correlation being almost the same as the correlation between red and black bet wins at ~-0.947.

#### Zero Bet Win and All Other Bet Types:

There is a weak negative correlation, making sense because zero does not belong to Red, Black, Even, or Odd categories, so its outcome is only weakly related to the others. This highlights the Casino house advantage because zero reduces the probability of winning any standard bet type.

#### No Significant Correlation Between Non-Complementary Bets:
For example, the correlation between Red Bet Win and Even Bet Win is weak (~-0.08), indicating that these outcomes are largely independent. The independence between the variables means betting strategies that rely on combining these types of bets won't gain an edge over the house.

#### The Success Rate of Different Bet Types

![Result](/assets/img/win_rates.png)

The success rates for colors are all quite similar at around 48.5%. This is expected for roulette because they are near 50/50 bets (near due to the presence of the "Zero" slot (the green 0), which gives the house a slight advantage)



### Takeaways
Overall, I observed that the numbers were fairly evenly distributed, as expected in a roulette game, with no number occurring disproportionately. The distribution of colors had also followed expectations. Red and Black had almost the same number of occurrences, while Green (aka Zero) appeared much less frequently. I also examined the relationship between color and the number outcome. Unsurprisingly, the distribution of colors for the numbers was fairly consistent with the standard roulette wheel. I visualized the data using bar plots for the frequency of each color and number. These plots gave a clear view of the even distribution of the numbers, and the relative infrequency of Green. The distribution of numbers and colors aligns closely with the expected probabilities of a fair roulette game. There is no evidence of any strategic component influencing the outcomes, as the numbers and colors appear randomly distributed. This aligns with the nature of roulette, where the results are determined by chance.
